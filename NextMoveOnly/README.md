# Logic for Solving Next Move Only

This code provides the logic for utilizing A* search to only find the next best move, rather than calculating the entire tree. This causes inefficienies, as the search essentially operates as a greedy search and is therefore not complete nor optimal in this scenario. Additionally, this implementation does not attempt to contribute to the final solution path, instead only minimizing the heuristic function. This ends up in significantly unoptimal paths, even when attempting to utilize weight penalties, linear conflicts, and heuristic scaling. I believe that the best way to do it this way would be to simulate a complete a* or UCS search within the heuristic, which is unreasonable when the complete path can be computed from the start *(see puzzleSolver.py)* by using a normal A* function.
